This document summarizes my work concerning the Vitamin-D GWAS in the UKB. It is composed by several parts:

* **Phenotype description**: explains - how to get the Vitamin-D phenotype - clean it - interaction with period. 
* **run GWAS**: the code I used to run the GWAS with plink and description of its result.
* **SMR**: description of the SMR pipeline to find putative genes under the discovered SNPs.
* **GSMR**: description of the GSMR pipeline to find out if Vitamin-D has a causal effect on several mental diseases.
* **XIa et al**: GSMR run on their GWAS summary statistics.
